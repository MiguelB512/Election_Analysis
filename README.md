# Election_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze and summarize the election results for three Colorado counties and output the results into an easy to read text file. When completed, the text file shows analytics such as votes per county, total votes, the winner of the election and more. The benefit of using code and computers to do the work for us is vastly greater than sitting and counting the votes by hand. Using Python, math equations and election results can be displayed in mere seconds. 

## Election-Audit Results

### Total Votes

In total, there were 369,711 votes cast between the three counties. As of 2020, the combined population of these counties was 1,944,653 total residents. This means that the percentage of people who votes was 19.01%. This seems low, but we have to take into account that many of these residents could be minors, new to the area, or not have American Citizenship as of the time of the election. 

### Votes per County

When looking at votes per county it's clear that Denver county had the larget turnout at 82.8% of the total votes. One might think that this is because Denver has a higher population, but that is not quite the case. The population of Denver county (715,878) is not much bigger than Arapahoe (649,980) or Jefferson (578,795), yet it has a 70% higher turnout rate than the next county (Jefferson). From this analysis, it is unclear why that may be the case.
